## Project 6

### Summary
I created an bar chart explaining how passenger class affect the survival rate of Titanic. 1st Class passengers are most likely to suvive in the incident, followed by 2nd class and 3 rd class.

### Feedback

Person 1: Eli
The visulization lacks of a effective title and proper explanation. But overall it is clear and nicely made.

Person 2: XD
It is pretty self-explantory and it would be much better if you can put some text to explain what you're trying to convey.

Person 3: Teresa
The choice of colors could be better. Like a darker color for death and a lighter and brighter one for survivied.

## Design
### Chart Type
I choose Bar Chart for it simpicity and easy to understand.

### Visual encodings
