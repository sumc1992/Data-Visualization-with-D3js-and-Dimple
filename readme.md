## Project 6

### Summary
I created an bar chart explaining how passenger class and gender affect the survival of Titanic.

### Feedback

Person 1: Eli
The visulization lacks of a effective title and proper explanation. But overall it is clear and nicely made.

Person 2: XD
It is pretty self-explantory and it would be much better if you can put some text to explain what you're trying to convey.

Person 3: Teresa
The choice of colors could be better. Like a darker color for death and a lighter and brighter one for survivied.
